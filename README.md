- **Search-first approach:** The homepage features a prominent search bar and "Surprise Me" button, encouraging users to find recipes immediately.
- **Visual clarity:** Cards, badges, and hero sections use contrasting colors and shadows to guide attention to important content.
- **Readability:** Clear typography and spacing make instructions, ingredients, and recipe details easy to read.
- **Mobile-first responsiveness:** Components adjust layout for smaller screens to maintain usability across devices.
